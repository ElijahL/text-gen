# TextGen
It's my notebook on text generation research. 

1. First is the markov chain TextGen. 
 - The class and functions are from [this article](https://tproger.ru/translations/markov-chains/#583_3), which is a translation of [another article](https://hackernoon.com/from-what-is-a-markov-model-to-here-is-how-markov-models-work-1ac5f4629b71#.3wu087d82). 
 - generate_random_sentence() function didn't work for higher order markov chain model (2 and more words in a window). So I fixed it.
